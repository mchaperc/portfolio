        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! Thanks for visiting my portfolio to learn a little more about me and my progress as a prospective front-end developer.  First, a little about myself:</p><br/>
        <p>I've spent the last 12 years teaching music in various forms and capacities, with the last 5 of those having been full-time.  During that time, I've been able to be a part of some amazing performances and ensembles that have received countless awards - if you're curious about the sort of thing, just ask! Now, I'm ready to take the creativity that fostered my love for music and redirect it toward new endeavors in technology.</p><br/>
        <p>I am a graduate of North Greenville University with a Bachelors Degree in Music-Education and have nearly completed a Masters of Music Performance (with a focus on compostion) from Converse College. While in grad school, I really developed a love for composing music - once again, the creative aspect has really drawn me to this point. Most recently, I've been self-studying since June 2014 about HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and a bit of Java.  I'm also currently enrolled in the Thinkful Front-End Web Development Course, with plans to take further courses after its completion.</p><br/>
        <p>If you're dying to know more about me, click on the various buttons seen below. Compositions will allow you to hear some of the pieces I've written as well as read a short blurb about it. Hobbies will give you a bit of insight into what keeps my life nice and balanced.</p>
        <ul class="btn">

          <button class="music"><span title="Compositions"><i class="fa fa-music fa-2x"></i></span></button>

            <h2>First Website:</h2>
            <p>I share this not as an effort to show how awesome at building websites I was from the beginning, but to show the degree to which I've progressed in a relatively short period of time.</p>

            <h2>StreetFighter with jQuery:</h2>
            <p>As a kid, I loved playing the classic StreetFighter games. Who knew I'd have to do an assignment to "animate" Ryu using jQuery? This is my first project using jQuery.</p>

            <h2>Simple JavaScript Quiz:</h2>
            <p>This was an exercise in the utilization of JavaScript as a form validation tool. I plan on expanding upon it and demonstrating further validation techniques and even user  in the near future.</p>

          <li>
            <h2>Shopping List:</h2>
            <p>Despite the limited parameters of this assignment, I'm going to continue building on it as I feel that it'd serve my wife and me quite well. Future functionality will include: tabs for various stores, saved lists from previous trips, item quantities, and a cost tabulator.</p>

          <li>
            <h2>FizzBuzz:</h2>
            <p>Just a little creation to display basic JavaScript programming knowledge. The point of the "game" is to enter a maximum number, then the program will print Fizz for numbers divisible by 3, Buzz for numbers divisible by 5, FizzBuzz for numbers divisible by both, and the number if it isn't divisible by either.</p>

            <h2>Hot or Cold Game:</h2>
            <p>This game asks for an input between 1 and 100. It will then randomly generate a number and check the accuracy of your guess. It will provide feedback based on your proximity to the generated number while keeping track of already guessed numbers and guess attempts.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript Quiz 2:</h2>
            <p>This time around, the quiz app in interactive - it keeps track of progress, score, and loads one question at a time. Each question is stored in and retrieved from JS objects.</p>

            <h2>Stack Exchange Reputation Builder:</h2>
            <p>Handling AJAX requests to the Stack Exchange API, this app takes either a tag (or several tags) and returns unanswered questions from Stack Overflow, or it takes a tag for which it finds the top rated answerers from Stack Overflow.</p>

            <h2>Trending Skills:</h2>
            <p>This project required that I find an API of my choice and integrate it into an app that is built from scratch. My project utilizes the Trendy Skills API, which keeps track of the number and type of jobs available by tech languages/skills.</p>
