        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! Thanks for visiting my portfolio to learn a little more about me and my progress as a prospective front-end developer.  First, a little about myself:</p>
        <p>I've spent the last 12 years teaching music in various forms and capacities, with the last 5 of those having been full-time.  During that time, I've been able to be a part of some amazing performances and ensembles that have received countless awards - if you're curious about the sort of thing, just ask! Now, I'm ready to take the creativity that fostered my love for music and redirect it toward new endeavors in technology.</p>
        <p>If you're dying to know more about me or would like to hear a few of the pieces I've written for my ensembles, click the buttons below!</p>

          <p>NOTE: Each of the following pieces have recordings that you may listen to along with the written descriptions. In order to play the recordings, press the number that corresponds with each to begin playback ("1" for "The Right", "2" for "Among the Stars," and "3" for "To Build Anew." If you wish to stop playback, press the corresponding number again.</p>
          <h3>1) The Right</h3>
          <p>"The Right" was written for the 2014 Union County High School Indoor Percussion Ensemble's competitive show. With it, they won the 2014 State Championship, CIPA Championship (schools from SC, NC, TN, and VA), and finished 14th place at the WGI World Championships. The show utilizes the word "Right" and attempts to play off of it many different ways: right hand only passages, visual representations of arrows pointing to the right, the "Rite of Spring," Civil Rights, Miranda Rights, and Individual Rights guaranteed in the Constitution. Listen for patriotic tunes strewn about to emphasize the individual rights, Igor Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring," and an African Spiritual over which vocal samples from Martin Luther King Jr's "I have a Dream" speech hammer home the message.</p>
          <h3>2) Among the Stars</h3>
          <p>A motto I learned from a mentor of mine years ago reads something like this: "If you shoot for the moon and miss, you'll land among the stars." My interpretation is a principle by which I've tried to live my life and one I've taught my students. This was a show that was written for the 2014 UCHS Marching Band's competitive show. "To Build Anew" is the story of a child who dreams of someday becoming an astronaut.  The show starts with a child staring off into space. Children's themes are played in the background as the child drifts to sleep. From there, a launch sequence is initiated and the dream begins. Follow along as the child visits places like the moon and two planets (Jupiter and Mars, where the child will encounter aliens!), courtesy of Gustav Holst's suite "The Planets." Vocal samples are scattered throughout and serve as narration for key moments, such as: "Someday when I grow up, I want to be an astronaut," or "Houston, we have a problem." </p>
          <h3>3) The Teller's Story:</h3>
          <p>This piece was written for the inaugural season of the Limestone College indoor percussion ensemble, Saints Percussion. "The Teller's Story" is a quick look into the life of poet Edgar Allen Poe. It takes the audience on a tour of the early years of his life: from his enrollment into university where he fell in love with writing, to meeting his wife and once again falling in love, to her tragic death and his descent into madness.</p>

          <h3>Education:</h3>
          <p>I am a graduate of North Greenville University with a Bachelors Degree in Music-Education and have nearly completed a Masters of Music Performance (with a focus on compostion) from Converse College. While in grad school, I really developed a love for composing music - once again, the creative aspect has really drawn me to this point. Most recently, I've been self-studying since June 2014 on topics such as: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (jQuery, AJAX, JSON), and a bit of Java.  I also recently completed the Thinkful Front-End Web Development Course, with plans to take further courses in Angular and Node after its completion. Being a naturally voracious learner, I eagerly anticipate continuing my quest for technical prowess.</p><br/>
          <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
          <p>I'm an avid mountain biker (when work allows!). I first started riding about 5 years ago and have been in love ever since. My current "whip" is a Scott Spark 940.</p>
          <p>When I'm not working or riding my bike, I also thoroughly enjoy games of all kinds. I've been known to design my own games when the ones I've got become boring (my first foray into coding came from designing my own MUD back in high school). Video games, board games, card games, etc... They're all great!</p>
          <h3>Family:</h3>
          <p>I married my beautiful and talented wife coming up on 2 years ago this summer. We also have a terrific dog who also loves to mountain bike (well, technically she's running, but she doesn't have to know that...), play fetch with anything you'll throw, and watch me play video games.</p>

            <p>I share this not as an effort to show how awesome at building websites I was from the beginning, but to show the degree to which I've progressed in a relatively short period of time.</p>

            <h2>StreetFighter with jQuery:</h2>
            <p>As a kid, I loved playing the classic StreetFighter games. Who knew I'd have to do an assignment to "animate" Ryu using jQuery? This is my first project using jQuery.</p>

            <h2>Simple JavaScript Quiz:</h2>
            <p>This was an exercise in the utilization of JavaScript as a form validation tool. I plan on expanding upon it and demonstrating further validation techniques and even user  in the near future.</p>

            <h2>Shopping List:</h2>
            <p>Despite the limited parameters of this assignment, I'm going to continue building on it as I feel that it'd serve my wife and me quite well. Future functionality will include: tabs for various stores, saved lists from previous trips, item quantities, and a cost tabulator.</p>

            <h2>FizzBuzz:</h2>
            <p>Just a little creation to display basic JavaScript programming knowledge. The point of the "game" is to enter a maximum number, then the program will print Fizz for numbers divisible by 3, Buzz for numbers divisible by 5, FizzBuzz for numbers divisible by both, and the number if it isn't divisible by either.</p>

            <h2>Hot or Cold Game:</h2>
            <p>This game asks for an input between 1 and 100. It will then randomly generate a number and check the accuracy of your guess. It will provide feedback based on your proximity to the generated number while keeping track of already guessed numbers and guess attempts.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript Quiz 2:</h2>
            <p>This time around, the quiz app in interactive - it keeps track of progress, score, and loads one question at a time. Each question is stored in and retrieved from JS objects.</p>

            <h2>Stack Exchange Reputation Builder:</h2>
            <p>An assignment from the FEWD Course at Thinkful, this project required me to complete the functionality of an already begun app. Utilizing AJAX calls to return data from Stack Exchange's API.</p>

            <h2>Trending Skills:</h2>
            <p>This project required that I find an API of my choice and integrate it into an app that is built from scratch. My project utilizes the Trendy Skills API, which keeps track of the number and type of jobs available by tech languages/skills.</p>
