        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! Thanks for visiting my portfolio. First, a little about me:</p>
        <p>Prior to fully committing to beginning my journey as a Front-End Engineer, I spent the last 12 years teaching music in various forms and capacities, with the last 5 of those having been full-time. I spent a year in self-study, attended <a href="www.theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a>, and have been working with BenefitFocus since August 2015. In the meantime, I've also Co-Founded Software Juice, LLC, which specializes in custom web-apps and software.</p>
        <p>Skillset:</p>

          <h2>Pieces of Note:</h2>
          <p>NOTE: Each of the following pieces have recordings that you may listen to along with the written descriptions. In order to play the recordings, press the number that corresponds with each to begin playback ("1" for "The Right", "2" for "Among the Stars," and "3" for "To Build Anew." If you wish to stop playback, press the corresponding number again.</p>
          <h3>1) The Right</h3>
          <p>"The Right" was written for the 2014 Union County High School Indoor Percussion Ensemble's competitive show. With it, they won the 2014 State Championship, CIPA Championship (schools from SC, NC, TN, and VA), and finished 14th place at the WGI World Championships. The show utilizes the word "Right" and attempts to play off of it many different ways: right hand only passages, visual representations of arrows pointing to the right, the "Rite of Spring," Civil Rights, Miranda Rights, and Individual Rights guaranteed in the Constitution. Listen for patriotic tunes strewn about to emphasize the individual rights, Igor Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring," and an African Spiritual over which vocal samples from Martin Luther King Jr's "I have a Dream" speech hammer home the message.</p>
          <h3>2) Among the Stars</h3>
          <p>A motto I learned from a mentor of mine years ago reads something like this: "If you shoot for the moon and miss, you'll land among the stars." My interpretation is a principle by which I've tried to live my life and one I've taught my students. This was a show that was written for the 2014 UCHS Marching Band's competitive show. "Among the Stars" is the story of a child who dreams of someday becoming an astronaut.  The show starts with a child staring off into space. Children's themes are played in the background as the child drifts to sleep. From there, a launch sequence is initiated and the dream begins. Follow along as the child visits places like the moon and two planets (Jupiter and Mars - where the child will encounter aliens!), courtesy of Gustav Holst's suite "The Planets." Vocal samples, such as: "Someday when I grow up, I want to be an astronaut," or "Houston, we have a problem," are scattered throughout and serve as narration for key moments. </p>
          <h3>3) The Teller's Story:</h3>
          <p>This piece was written for the inaugural season of the Limestone College indoor percussion ensemble, Saints Percussion. "The Teller's Story" is a quick look into the life of poet Edgar Allen Poe. It takes the audience on a tour of the early years of his life: from his enrollment into university where he fell in love with writing, to meeting his wife and once again falling in love, to her tragic death and his descent into madness.</p>

          <h2>More about Me:</h2>
          <h3>Education:</h3>
          <p>I am a graduate of North Greenville University with a Bachelors Degree in Music-Education and have nearly completed a Masters of Music Performance (with a focus on compostion) from Converse College. While in grad school, I really developed a love for composing music - the creative parallels that can be drawn between coding and music, particularly composition, are incredible! Being a naturally voracious learner, I eagerly anticipate continuing my quest for technical prowess.</p><br/>
          <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
          <p>I'm an avid mountain biker (when work allows!). I first started riding about 5 years ago and have been in love ever since. My current "whip" is a Scott Spark 940.</p>
          <p>When I'm not working or riding my bike, I also thoroughly enjoy games of all kinds. I've been known to design my own games when the ones I've got become boring (my first foray into coding came from designing my own MUD back in high school). Video games, board games, card games, etc... They're all great!</p>
          <h3>Family:</h3>
          <p>I married my beautiful and talented wife coming up on 3 years ago this summer. We also have a terrific dog who loves to mountain bike (well, technically she's running, but she doesn't have to know that...), play fetch with anything you'll throw, and watch me play video games.</p>

            <h2>Shopping List:</h2>
            <p>Much as it sounds, this project was intended to be a simple app for storing a grocery list, as well as allowing the user to generate a rough estimate for the cost of a shopping trip.  Utilizes HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript Quiz:</h2>
            <p>This time around, the quiz app in interactive - it keeps track of progress, score, and loads one question at a time. Each question is stored in and retrieved from JS objects. Utilizes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery.</p>

            <h2>Pixel Perfect:</h2>
            <p>This project required that I accurately replicate, to the pixel, a design that was provided. This required to the use of color grabbers, pixel measurments, etc... The end result is NOT responsive, as it was designed for a specific screen measurement. Utilizes HTML5 and CSS3.</p>

            <p>This assignment asked that we replicate the functionality of a calculator, but that it needed to also be responsive to screen size. Utilizes HTML5, SCSS, Bourbon, Neat, JavaScript.</p>

            <h2>Final Project:</h2>
            <p>This project was a showcase of what I'd learned and where I hope to take that knowledge. Unfortunately, in the time since my graduation last July, several of the APIs that were used have been taken down, leaving a less full experience. If you're interested in the tech used in the project, just open up your console on the landing page.</p>

            <h2>Orchestra:</h2>
            <p>My wife is an orchestra/music teacher. My wife has asked that I replicate <a href="http://colouredlines.com.au/">this design</a> for her classroom website. It also allowed me to spend some time, when I first started at BenefitFocus, learning some of the technologies I either didn't know, or wasn't yet strong with, such as: RequireJS, Marionette, LESS, and Bootstrap.</p>

            <h2>Time-keeping:</h2>
            <p>Someone at work one day suggested that we build our own internal timekeeping application and it sparked an idea for a project. I needed to get better at modular coding and reusable components, so I decided to build a dummy, but functional, app to do so (there are also sections where I'll be able to explore more data analysis and visualization at a later date). The main technologies used are: Backbone/Marionette, RequireJS, LESS, Bootstrap, and Gulp.</p>
